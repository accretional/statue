The web evolves fast. What felt cutting-edge last year is now table stakes. Let's explore the trends defining 2026—and I'll show you real examples along the way. **Hover over any link to preview the page.**

## 1. Documentation-First Design

Companies are realizing that great docs are great marketing. Look at how <LinkPreview href="https://stripe.com/docs">Stripe's documentation</LinkPreview> became the gold standard—clean, searchable, and genuinely helpful.

The best developer tools now treat documentation as a first-class product. <LinkPreview href="https://docs.github.com">GitHub's docs</LinkPreview> follow the same philosophy: comprehensive yet navigable.

Even static site generators like Statue embrace this. Check out our <LinkPreview href="/docs/get-started">getting started guide</LinkPreview> or the <LinkPreview href="/docs/components">components reference</LinkPreview> to see how simple documentation can be.

## 2. The Return of Minimalism

After years of gradient-heavy, animation-laden sites, minimalism is back. <LinkPreview href="https://linear.app">Linear</LinkPreview> pioneered this aesthetic—dark themes, sharp typography, zero clutter.

Compare this to how content sites are structured now. Our <LinkPreview href="/docs/themes">theming system</LinkPreview> supports both light and dark modes out of the box, because users expect that choice.

---

## 3. Component-Driven Everything

Atomic design won. Every modern site is built from composable pieces. Whether you're using <LinkPreview href="https://tailwindcss.com">Tailwind CSS</LinkPreview> for utility classes or a full component library, modularity is non-negotiable.

Statue ships with <LinkPreview href="/docs/components">pre-built components</LinkPreview> that you can mix, match, and customize. Need a hero section? A blog grid? A navigation bar? They're all there.

---

## 4. Markdown as the Universal Format

Content creators don't want to learn proprietary formats. They want <LinkPreview href="https://www.markdownguide.org">Markdown</LinkPreview>—simple, portable, version-controllable.

This is why our <LinkPreview href="/docs/routing">routing system</LinkPreview> is built entirely around markdown files. Drop a `.md` file in a folder, and it becomes a page. No database, no CMS login, no friction.

---

## 5. Performance as a Feature

Core Web Vitals changed the game. Speed isn't just nice-to-have—it affects search rankings. Static site generators like Statue shine here because there's no server rendering on each request.

The <LinkPreview href="/docs/site-config">site configuration</LinkPreview> lets you optimize images, enable search indexing, and fine-tune SEO—all from a single JSON file.

---

## 6. Built-in Search

Users expect to find things instantly. <LinkPreview href="https://pagefind.app">Pagefind</LinkPreview> has become the go-to solution for static sites, and we've <LinkPreview href="/docs/search">integrated it directly</LinkPreview> into Statue.

No external service, no API keys, no monthly fees. Just fast, client-side search that works offline.

The trends above share a common thread: **simplicity**. The best tools get out of your way and let you focus on content.
