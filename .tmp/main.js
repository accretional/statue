Many a great thinker has stared into the abyss and lost themselves in an episemic spiral. Questions are answered by bigger, harder questions.</p>\n<p>Like the sun, most learn to simply look away. It is enough to feel its presence and know that it is there; starting at it can only hurt you.</p>\n<p>That is, until now.</p>\n<h1>TRUTH</h1>\n<p>Transformers Reasoning Under Teleological Hermeneutics (TRUTH) TRUTH is a state of the art transformer model designed to answer life&#39;s deepest questions. With an over 95% passing score on ThinkBench, there is no question as to its market-leading accuracy and performance: it outperforms 98% of fully verified free thinkers contributing to the ThinkBench dataset, and is capable of inference at an astounding 800 tokens per second.</p>\n<p>TRUTH is fully deterministic and requires only 14B parameters because of its unique approach to conceptualizing problems. TRUTH is trained not to &quot;model the truth&quot; so much as to reframe questions requiring deep insights in simpler terms that address the underlying concern.</p>\n<h1>How TRUTH Works</h1>\n<p>At its core, TRUTH operates on a revolutionary principle: LLM accuracy is not a matter of right or wrong, but in providing satisfying responses. Where traditional AI models attempt to parse language, TRUTH deconstructs philosophical inquiries into their most fundamental epistemological components, and then uses that to predict what the person behind the question really wants. It doesn&#39;t just respond — it reimagines the very framework under which the underlying problem exists. It&#39;s difficult for TRUTH to be wrong when it&#39;s the one asking the questions.</p>\n<p>Take, for instance, the classic philosophical conundrum: &quot;If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?&quot; TRUTH doesn&#39;t just provide a binary yes or no. Instead, it generates a multi-page response that explores acoustic physics, phenomenological perception, and the nature of sensory experience—all within milliseconds. These factual responses addressing different motivations behind the question, without directly taking and defending a position, allow TRUTH to provide adequate answers to the hardest philosphical questions without consuming disproporationate amounts of computational resources.</p>\n<h1>The Future of Knowledge</h1>\n<p>TRUTH represents more than a technological breakthrough. It is a bridge between language modeling and philosophical insight. As we continue to develop and refine TRUTH, we are not just making incremental improvements on questionable benchmarks - we are pushing the boundary of technology towards a future where any philosphical quandary has a quick, computationally efficient answer. </p>\n","metadata":{"title":"TRUTH - A New Paradigm in AI Philosophy","description":"Exploring how TRUTH is revolutionizing our approach to philosophical questions through advanced language modeling"}}]},{"name":"docs","title":"Documentation","sourceDir":"content/docs","format":"markdown","outputDir":"docs","listable":true,"hierarchical":true,"pages":[{"slug":"configuration","path":"advanced/configuration.md","url":"/docs/advanced/configuration","content":"<h1>Advanced Configuration</h1>\n<p>This guide covers advanced configuration options for power users.</p>\n<h2>Environment Variables</h2>\n<p>Our platform supports the following advanced environment variables:</p>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th>Variable</th>\n<th>Description</th>\n<th>Default</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody><tr>\n<td><code>DEBUG_MODE</code></td>\n<td>Enables debug logging</td>\n<td><code>false</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>CACHE_TTL</code></td>\n<td>Cache time-to-live in seconds</td>\n<td><code>3600</code></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><code>MAX_CONNECTIONS</code></td>\n<td>Maximum number of concurrent connections</td>\n<td><code>100</code></td>\n</tr>\n</tbody></table>\n<h2>Custom Plugins</h2>\n<p>You can extend the platform&#39;s functionality with custom plugins:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-javascript\">// plugins/my-custom-plugin.js\nexport default {\n  name: &#39;my-custom-plugin&#39;,\n  async initialize(context) {\n    // Plugin initialization logic\n  },\n  hooks: {\n    beforeRender(data) {\n      // Modify data before rendering\n      return modifiedData;\n    }\n  }\n};\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Performance Tuning</h2>\n<p>For high-traffic sites, consider the following performance optimizations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Enable the production mode</li>\n<li>Implement proper caching strategies</li>\n<li>Use a CDN for static assets</li>\n<li>Optimize database queries</li>\n</ol>\n<p>For more information, refer to our <a href=\"/docs/performance\">Performance Guide</a>. </p>\n","metadata":{"title":"Advanced Configuration","description":"Learn about advanced configuration options"}},{"slug":"getting-started","path":"getting-started.md","url":"/docs/getting-started","content":"<h1>Getting Started</h1>\n<p>This guide will help you get started with our platform.
