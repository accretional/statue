# Hello World

Welcome to our first blog post. This is a sample markdown file that will be converted to HTML and displayed on our site.

## Markdown Features

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, which then converts to valid HTML for viewing on a website.

### Some examples:

- **Bold text** is created using double asterisks
- *Italic text* is created using single asterisks
- [Links](https://example.com) are created using square brackets and parentheses

### Code blocks

```javascript
// This is a code block
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, world!");
}
```

## Next Steps

In future posts, we'll explore more advanced features and integrations with our static site generator.
